# OneTools: More Than Just One Tool

## Motivation

`OneTools` was born out of a desire to experiment with interesting ideas and techniques. Often, these ideas remain just that - ideas. They are not practical or tangible. OneTools provides a platform to bring these small but interesting ideas to life. For instance, consider the need for a `simple image processing` tool for identification photos. While there are free online tools available, they are often cluttered with advertisements. OneTools offers a clean, ad-free alternative for basic image processing. The possibilities with OneTools are endless. With the rise of deep learning and `AI`, these technologies are becoming an integral part of our lives. Imagine the potential of using AI for writing or coding. Without AI, it's hard to imagine how much less efficient we could be. As we become more dependent on generative tools in our lives, why not try to create something powerful with `Deep learning`?
